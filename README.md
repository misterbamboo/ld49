# Flower Lab

## About the game
Flower Lab follows the work of a little scientist devoted to save his best friend: Gus, La Fleur. Sadly, our little yellow guy doesnâ€™t seem to remember how to make the perfect fertilizer. Will he be able to save Gus, La Fleur in this environment full of dangerous and unstable chemical elements?

## Gameplay
Prepare a piece of paper and a pencil because you will need to remember chemical mixtures!

6 unstable elements will be at your disposal to give your friend the longest lifetime possible: Red, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Green and Unstable matter. Will you feed them directly to your friend or will you mix multiple elements before?

You can also consume your own mixes to give you an idea if it will help Gus, La Fleur.

## Controls
